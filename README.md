##  Project Description

**Tic Tac Toe** is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with either `X` or `O`. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
This Python-based project implements the game for:
- **Player vs Player**
- **Player vs AI (Computer)**
The project runs directly in the console and is ideal for beginners learning game logic, control flow, and condition handling in Python.

## Features Implemented
 **Console-based user interface**  
 **Player vs Player mode**  
 **Player vs AI mode (randomized AI)**  
 **Smart input validation** (prevents overwriting and invalid moves)  
 **Win detection for all directions**  
 **Draw (tie) detection**  
 **Scoreboard tracking** across multiple rounds  
 **Replay option after each match**
