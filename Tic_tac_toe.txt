 Code Breakdown

1. Main Entry Point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tic_tac_toe()
Starts the game by calling tic_tac_toe() when the script is run.

2. Game Mode Selection
def tic_tac_toe():
    ...
    choice = input("Choose game mode (1 or 2): ")
Lets you choose between:
1 ➝ Player vs Player
2 ➝ Player vs AI
Stores your choice in vs_ai

3. Game Loop + Scoreboard
scores = {"X": 0, "O": 0, "Ties": 0}
while True:
    scores = play_game(vs_ai=vs_ai, scores=scores)
Initializes a scoreboard
Plays the game in a loop so you can play again and again
Keeps updating and showing the scores after each match

4. play_game Function
This is the heart of the game.
def play_game(vs_ai=False, scores={"X": 0, "O": 0, "Ties": 0}):
    board = [[" " for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
Creates a 3x3 empty board:
[
 [" ", " ", " "],
 [" ", " ", " "],
 [" ", " ", " "]
]

5. Game Turns
while True:
    if vs_ai and current_player == "O":
        row, col = ai_move(board)
    else:
        row = int(input(...)) - 1
        col = int(input(...)) - 1
If it's AI’s turn, it uses the ai_move function to pick a random empty cell.
If it’s a player’s turn, it takes manual input.

6. Making a Move
if board[row][col] == " ":
    board[row][col] = current_player
Puts 'X' or 'O' in the chosen cell
Prints the updated board after each move

7. Win & Tie Checks
if check_win(board, current_player):
    ...
elif is_full(board):
    ...
check_win: Checks all rows, columns, and diagonals
is_full: Checks if the board is completely filled
Updates the scores accordingly

8. AI Move Logic
def ai_move(board):
    empty_cells = get_empty_cells(board)
    return random.choice(empty_cells)
AI picks a random move from all available (empty) cells

9. Game Replay
again = input(" Play again? (y/n): ").lower()
if again != 'y':
    break
Lets the player decide whether to replay or exit

Game Flow Example
Let’s say you pick Player vs AI:
You go first (as 'X')
AI goes second (as 'O')
Each move is printed on the board
When someone wins or it's a tie, the result and scoreboard are printed
You’re asked if you want to play again
